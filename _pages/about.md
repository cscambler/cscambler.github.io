*** WEBSITE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION ***

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in philosophy at All Souls College, Oxford University. My main areas of research interest involve logic, metaphysics, foundations of mathematics. My favorite issues to think about involve healthy doses of each. 

My current project, `modal logicism', explores the idea that modal logic can be used to provide a constructively inspired foundation for mathematics that is at least as plausible as the more familiar, purely quantificational accounts in the broadly Fregean tradition. The project has facets in metaphysics, philosophical logic, and philosophy of mathematics.
