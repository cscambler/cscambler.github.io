I am a postdoctoral research fellow in philosophy at All Souls College, Oxford University. My main areas of research interest involve logic, metaphysics, foundations of mathematics. My favorite issues to think about involve healthy doses of each. 

The problem that interests me most in philosophy is the broadly Kantian project of disentangling ways the world truly is, in itself as it were, from ways we merely tend to speak or think of at is being as a result of arbitrary features of grammar or conceptual scheme. This general problem has many variants in philosophy and much (but not all) of my work is directed at such variants. (Seeing the links is, I admit, sometimes an exercise for the reader.)
