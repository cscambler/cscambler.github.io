*** WEBSITE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION ***

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in philosophy at All Souls College, Oxford University. My main areas of research interest are logic, metaphysics, foundations of mathematics. My favorite issues to think about involve healthy doses of each. 

My current project, 'modal logicism', explores the idea that modal logic can be used to provide a constructively inspired foundation for mathematics, and to explain the advantages had by such a foundation over the traditional, purely quantificational accounts. I argue that the account can solve the traditional puzzles about the epistemology of mathematics, the applicability of mathematics in the physical world, and that it provides a clear solution to the paradoxes that arose for traditional brands of Fregean/Russelian logicism.
