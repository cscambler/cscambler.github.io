I am a postdoctoral research fellow in philosophy 
at All Souls College, Oxford University. My main 
areas of research interest are logic, metaphysics, 
foundations of mathematics, and I have subsidiary 
interests in a range of topics including 
philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and 
philosophy of physics. 

The focal project of my All Souls fellowship, 
'modal logicism', explores the idea that modal 
logic can be used resuscitate the core ideas of 
Fregean/Russellian logicism: that is, that the 
theorems of mathematics can be derived in the "pure" logic
of quantification theory. I also have active research 
interests regarding the semantic paradoxes and the independence 
phenomenon in set theory.
